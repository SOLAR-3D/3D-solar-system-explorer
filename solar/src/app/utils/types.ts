//added by Costanza. Feel free to add your own types too. This makes sense in this project but not in a bigger one, where you would have types in the component FOLDER itself.

export interface NewsContent {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  url: string;
  summary: string;
}

export interface ImageContent {
  imageUrl: string;
}

export interface RootState {
  fullNews: any;
  carouselSlice: any;
  images: ImageContent[];
  news: NewsContent[];
}
export interface IUser {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
  _id: string;
}
