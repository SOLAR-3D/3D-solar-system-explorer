## What is it?

What you need to know is that it's a carousel. This carousel can have different slides inside. These slides fetch images or news from external APIs. I am using random mock APIs for now and that's fine. Styling is not important. Chakra UI just setup for now.

## Redux

Started applying redux to carousel. Please apply it wherever else you think it needs to be applied.

## Tests

How many tests and which ones do I need for this carousel. Please help.
